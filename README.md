### What I learned

Hopfully, I have learned how to best place elements on a page where I want them to be and have the page be responsive with the viewport size.  I built and re-built this several times.  Each time I got it to look/react a little better.  I settled on a grid layout for the desktop view and a flexbox design for the mobile.  At least that is what I remember.  I had the page working well until I realized that it was beter practice to use the 'picture' element to change images rather than just hiding one or the other with a display: none.  When I changed this, I had all kinds of troble with my grid system for the product card.  I eventually found a soulution to set a minmax for the row height but I do not understand why it works or if I have done this in the most efficient way.  Ultimately, the page behaves as I want it to so I am submitting it for critique.  If there is an example of better or best code for the layout I would love to see it to compare my thought process to it.


### Continued development

I am feeling more confident, but want to have a really solid workflow about layout, spacing, image control etc.  A roadmap of how to approach a layout is what I want.
